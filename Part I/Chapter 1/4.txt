Q)  What is meant by “knowledge acquisition is not sequential”? 
    
    Provide a concrete example of knowledge acquisition that illustrates this.


A)  This phrase means that learning doesn’t always happen in a linear, step-by-step manner. 
    
    Instead, it can happen through various pathways, where learning in one area can lead to insights in another, 
    and learners can jump back and forth between different topics as their understanding deepens.


    Concrete example: Consider learning to play a musical instrument. 
    Initially, you might focus on learning basic chords (technical knowledge). 
    
    However, while practicing, you may also start to understand rhythm, song structure, and even some music theory (conceptual knowledge), 
    all of which enhance your skill without following a strict sequence. 
    
    You might discover a chord progression that leads you to revisit previous lessons with a new perspective, 
    showing how learning overlaps and revisits previous knowledge.
