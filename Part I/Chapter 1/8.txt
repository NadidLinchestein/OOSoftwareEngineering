Q)  In the following description, explain when the term account is used as an application
    domain concept and when as a solution domain concept:
    
    “Assume you are developing an online system for managing bank accounts for mobile customers. 
    A major design issue is how to provide access to the accounts when the customer cannot establish an online connection. 
    One proposal is that accounts are made available on the mobile computer, even if the server is not up. 
    In this case, the accounts show the amounts from the last connected session.”


A)  Application domain concept: 
    When “account” refers to the customer’s bank account, which holds financial information like balances and transactions, 
    it is an application domain concept because it refers to the real-world problem the system is addressing.

    Solution domain concept: 
    When “account” refers to how data about the bank account is stored or managed within the system (e.g., the account object in the software), 
    it is a solution domain concept, as it is a representation within the software solution.
