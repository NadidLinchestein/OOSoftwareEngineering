Q)  Hypothesize a rationale for the following design decisions:

    • “The TicketDistributor will be at most one and a half meters tall.”
    • “The TicketDistributor will include two redundant computer systems.”
    • “The TicketDistributor interface will consist of a touch screen for displaying instructions and accessing commands and a single button for aborting transactions.”


A)  “The TicketDistributor will be at most one and a half meters tall.”
    Rationale: This height could be chosen for accessibility, ensuring that people of varying heights, including those in wheelchairs or children, can easily reach and use the machine.
    
    “The TicketDistributor will include two redundant computer systems.”
    Rationale: Redundancy could be for reliability and fault tolerance. If one system fails, the second system can take over, ensuring continuous operation and minimizing downtime.
    
    “The TicketDistributor interface will consist of a touch screen for displaying instructions and accessing commands and a single button for aborting transactions.”
    Rationale: The touch screen provides an intuitive and flexible interface for interacting with users, while the single button for aborting transactions adds simplicity for canceling without navigating through menus. 
               This minimizes user confusion and reduces complexity.
