Q)  A programming language is a notation for representing algorithms and data structures.
    
    List two advantages and two disadvantages of using a programming language as the
    sole notation throughout the development process.


A)  Advantages of using a programming language as the sole notation throughout the development process:

    Consistency: Using a single notation (programming language) ensures uniformity throughout the development cycle, reducing the chances of misinterpretation.
    Direct implementation: Once a model is created in code, it can be executed, tested, and debugged in real-time, which speeds up the feedback loop.
    
    Disadvantages:

    Complexity: High-level models or system designs may be more difficult to express in code, making it hard for non-programmers to understand or contribute to the development process.
    Rigidity: Programming languages are less flexible for conceptual or exploratory stages of development, where rapid changes and adjustments are necessary without worrying about implementation specifics.
