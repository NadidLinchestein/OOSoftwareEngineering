Q)  Specify which of these decisions were made during requirements or system design:
    
    • “The TicketDistributor is composed of a user interface subsystem, a subsystem for computing tariff, 
       and a network subsystem for managing communication with the central computer.”
    • “The TicketDistributor hardware uses PowerPC processor chips.”
    • “The TicketDistributor provides the traveler with online help.”


A) “The TicketDistributor is composed of a user interface subsystem, a subsystem for computing tariff, and a network subsystem for managing communication with the central computer.”
    System design decision: This describes how the system will be structured or designed, specifying the major components or subsystems.
    
    “The TicketDistributor hardware uses PowerPC processor chips.”
    System design decision: This is a hardware design decision specifying the processor architecture to be used.
    
    “The TicketDistributor provides the traveler with online help.”
    Requirements decision: This is part of the user requirements, describing a functional feature that the system must provide.
