Q) What is the purpose of modeling?

A) Modeling refers to the process of creating abstract representations of a system or problem. 
   Its purpose is to simplify complex systems for better understanding, analysis, and communication. 
   It allows stakeholders to focus on key aspects without dealing with unnecessary details. 
   
   In software and engineering, models help in visualizing how components interact and 
   can be used to predict behavior or performance before building a solution.
