    • “The TicketDistributor must be easy to use.”
    • “The TicketDistributor must always be available.”

A)  “The TicketDistributor must enable a traveler to buy weekly passes.”
    Functional requirement: This defines a specific function or task that the system must perform.
    
    “The TicketDistributor must be written in Java.”
    Nonfunctional requirement: This specifies a constraint related to the technology or implementation, not a user function.
    
    “The TicketDistributor must be easy to use.”
    Nonfunctional requirement: This is a quality attribute related to usability but not a direct functional behavior.
    
    “The TicketDistributor must always be available.”
    Nonfunctional requirement: This is related to system availability, a performance characteristic, not a functional behavior.
    
    “The TicketDistributor must provide a phone number to call when it fails.”
    Functional requirement: This describes a specific function the system must provide to users when it fails.
