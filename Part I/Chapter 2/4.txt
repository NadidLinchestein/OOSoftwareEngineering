Q)  Draw a use case diagram for a ticket distributor for a train system. The system includes two actors: 
    
    a traveler who purchases different types of tickets, and a central computer system that maintains a reference database for the tariff. 
    
    Use cases should include BuyOneWayTicket, BuyWeeklyCard, BuyMonthlyCard, and UpdateTariff. 
    
    Also include the following exceptional cases: TimeOut (i.e., traveler took too long to insert the right
    amount), TransactionAborted (i.e., traveler selected the cancel button without completing the transaction), 
    DistributorOutOfChange, and DistributorOutOfPaper.


A)  The use case diagram should include:

    Actors: Traveler and Central Computer System.
    Use Cases: BuyOneWayTicket, BuyWeeklyCard, BuyMonthlyCard, UpdateTariff.
