Q)  What is the difference between a scenario and a use case? 
    When do you use each construct?


A)  Scenario: A specific sequence of actions or instance of a use case, showing a particular path or outcome.
    
    Use Case: A generalized interaction pattern, representing all possible scenarios within a specific function. 
    
    Use cases are used for overall system design, while scenarios are for detailing specific interactions.
