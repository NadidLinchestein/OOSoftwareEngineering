ARENA is a multi-user, Web-based system for organizing and conducting tournaments.

ARENA is game independent in the sense that organizers can adapt a new game to the ARENA game
interface, upload it to the ARENA server, and immediately announce and conduct tournaments
with players and spectators located anywhere on the Internet. Organizers can also define new
tournament styles, describing how players are mapped to a set of matches and how to compute
an overall ranking of players by adding up their victories and losses (hence, figuring out who
won the tournament). To recoup their operational costs, organizers can also invite potential
sponsors to display advertisement banners during games.
